# Media Messages Fix Summary

## Problem
Media messages (images, videos, documents) were not displaying in the frontend chat interface. They were being saved as type "chat" with no mediaId.

## Root Cause
1. WAHA returns media data differently than expected - the image data is embedded as base64 in the `_data.body` field
2. MessagePoller wasn't extracting media information from the WAHA response
3. No local storage mechanism for media files

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated MessagePoller.js
- Added detection for WAHA media format in `_data` field
- Extracts base64 data, mimetype, and other media properties
- Properly sets message type as "image" instead of "chat"

### 2. Created MediaHandler.js
- New service to handle media file storage
- Saves base64 data to local files in `backend/whatsapp/media/`
- Provides retrieval method for serving media files

### 3. Updated SimpleMessageQueue.js
- Added MediaHandler integration
- Saves media files when processing incoming messages
- Sets proper mediaId and mediaUrl for database storage

### 4. Updated API Routes
- Media endpoint now first checks local storage before trying WAHA
- Falls back to WAHA endpoints if media not found locally

### 5. Fixed Existing Messages
- Updated 9 existing media messages from type "chat" to "image"
- Set proper mediaId and mediaUrl for each

## Testing Results
✅ MessagePoller now correctly detects media messages
✅ Media files are saved to local storage
✅ Database records have correct type and media information
✅ Media can be retrieved via API endpoint

## How to Test
1. Send an image via WhatsApp to the connected number
2. Open the conversations page
3. The image should now display properly in the chat
4. Check `backend/whatsapp/media/` folder for saved media files

## Future Improvements
- Add support for video, audio, and document types
- Implement media cleanup for old files
- Add media compression/optimization
- Handle larger media files more efficiently
