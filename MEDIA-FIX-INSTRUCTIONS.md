# Media Display Fix - Final Steps

## Current Status
✅ Frontend updated to handle media URLs correctly
✅ Database has media messages with correct type and mediaUrl
✅ Media files saved locally (2 files)
❌ Backend not returning mediaId field in API responses

## Issue
The backend is still not returning the `mediaId` field even though we added it to the attributes list in `messageController.js`. This is likely because the backend hasn't been restarted with the changes.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Restart Backend
Run the batch file to safely restart the backend:
```
RESTART-BACKEND-SAFE.bat
```

This will:
- Kill existing backend processes on port 3001
- Start the backend with the updated code
- The backend will now include mediaId in message responses

### 2. Refresh Browser
After backend restarts:
1. Refresh the conversations page (F5)
2. Click on "Muchammad Edo Iskandar" contact
3. Images should now display properly

## What Was Fixed

### Frontend (conversations-beautiful.html)
- Fixed URL building to avoid double `/api/api/` issue
- Now correctly builds: `http://localhost:3001/api/messages/media/...`

### Backend (messageController.js)
- Added missing fields to attributes list:
  - mediaId
  - mediaMimeType
  - mediaSize
  - fileName

### Media Storage
- Created MediaHandler service for local file storage
- Saved 2 image files in `backend/whatsapp/media/`

## Verification
After restarting backend, images should display because:
1. Messages have `mediaUrl` pointing to correct endpoint
2. Media files exist locally
3. Frontend will build correct URLs

## Troubleshooting
If images still don't show:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Open Network tab and check if media requests succeed
3. Try directly accessing: http://localhost:3001/api/messages/media/false_6282255555000@c.us_3A7AEA606A724E752DDF
