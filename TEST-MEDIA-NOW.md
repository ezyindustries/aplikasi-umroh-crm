# Test Media Display - Final Step

## What Was Fixed

1. **Backend now returns mediaId field** - The API was not returning mediaId even though it was in the database
2. **Frontend URL construction fixed** - Removed double `/api/` in media URLs  
3. **Media files saved locally** - Images are stored in `backend/whatsapp/media/`

## Testing Steps

1. **Open the conversations page in your browser**
   - Go to: http://localhost:8080/frontend/conversations-beautiful.html
   - Or refresh if already open (F5)

2. **Click on "Muchammad Edo Iskandar"**
   - This contact has 4 image messages

3. **Images should now display!**
   - You should see thumbnail images in the chat
   - Click on images to view full size

## What to Check

✅ Images display as thumbnails in chat messages
✅ No more "undefined" mediaId in console
✅ No more CORS errors for media URLs
✅ Media URLs are correctly formed: `http://localhost:3001/api/messages/media/[mediaId]`

## If Images Still Don't Show

1. **Check browser console (F12)**
   - Look for any red errors
   - Check Network tab for failed media requests

2. **Verify backend is running**
   - The backend console should show it's running on port 3001
   - You can test: http://localhost:3001/api/health

3. **Try a hard refresh**
   - Ctrl+F5 to clear cache and reload

## Success Indicators

When working correctly, you'll see:
- Image thumbnails in chat bubbles
- Console logs showing: `Loading image from: http://localhost:3001/api/messages/media/...`
- Network tab showing 200 OK responses for media files
